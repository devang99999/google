majestic monuments of the walled city to the art galleries, trendy cafes and shopping streets, ahmedabad has a gamut of offerings. but for those with large appetites, the city holds many dleights. if you're in the city for just two days, here's where you should go and what you should eat.day 1: morningthe walled city of ahmedabad‚Äîor the old city‚Äîis a hive of activity with colourful bazaars, workshops, mosques, temples and old residential quarters called pols. it is best to get here early before the streets get too crowded for a casual walk around.start with breakfast at new irani restaurant near the bhadra fort. more than 60 years old and recently renovated, this caf√© is extremely popular for its bun maska ‚Äì you can see the workers slicing buns and buttering them near the arched entrance. if you are looking for a cooked breakfast, try the omelette and curries or a meat feast of paya, chicken masala and chaap.bun maska at new irani cafe.digest breakfast by walking around bhadra fort, the citadel founded by sultan ahmed shah in 1411 ad. there‚Äôs also teen darwaja, a triple archway built in the 15th century and jama masjid nearby, one of the most beautiful mosques in the country.mid-morning: feel like a cup of tea and a snack after the walk? chandra villas nearby is a restaurant that opened in 1898 and introduced the first ‚Äògujarati thali‚Äô of ahmedabad in 1901. the restaurant has, unfortunately, lost its oak furniture and british fans to a fire, but it still remains as popular has been for over a century. ask for the classic fafda-jalebi breakfast‚Äî the deep-fried crispy fafda pairs well with the sinfully sweet jalebi. it is served with a papaya relish called cheen, along with chopped onions, chillies and a kadhi-like dip. down this with a masala chai before continuing to explore some of the `pols‚Äô ‚Äì these are narrow alleys lined with old houses. you can see exquisitely carved wooded facades of havelis, perhaps a colourful jain or hindu temple, an ornate bird-feeding structure called chabutra, and other remnants of life in the old city.jalebi at chandra villas.from here, walk to the historical square called manek chowk. this forms the base to explore numerous markets: the sindhi market for fabrics and sarees, ratanpol where shop fronts showcase a variety from tailored shirts to colourful sarees, zaveri vad with its jewellery shops, dalgharwad for textiles and garments, and others. but should you find your stomach rumbling again, the bhatiyar galli of khas bazaar near manek chowk is a meat lovers haven. here you will find the cooks‚Äîknown as bhatiyaras frying meat on large tavas, ladling out meat on small plates, or making kebabs on charcoal stoves. bera samosa is one of the legendary names in this

majestic monuments of the walled city to the art galleries, trendy cafes and shopping streets, ahmedabad has a gamut of offerings. but for those with large appetites, the city holds many dleights. if you're in the city for just two days, here's where you should go and what you should eat.day 1: morningthe walled city of ahmedabad‚Äîor the old city‚Äîis a hive of activity with colourful bazaars, workshops, mosques, temples and old residential quarters called pols. it is best to get here early before the streets get too crowded for a casual walk around.start with breakfast at new irani restaurant near the bhadra fort. more than 60 years old and recently renovated, this caf√© is extremely popular for its bun maska ‚Äì you can see the workers slicing buns and buttering them near the arched entrance. if you are looking for a cooked breakfast, try the omelette and curries or a meat feast of paya, chicken masala and chaap.bun maska at new irani cafe.digest breakfast by walking around bhadra fort, the citadel founded by sultan ahmed shah in 1411 ad. there‚Äôs also teen darwaja, a triple archway built in the 15th century and jama masjid nearby, one of the most beautiful mosques in the country.mid-morning: feel like a cup of tea and a snack after the walk? chandra villas nearby is a restaurant that opened in 1898 and introduced the first ‚Äògujarati thali‚Äô of ahmedabad in 1901. the restaurant has, unfortunately, lost its oak furniture and british fans to a fire, but it still remains as popular has been for over a century. ask for the classic fafda-jalebi breakfast‚Äî the deep-fried crispy fafda pairs well with the sinfully sweet jalebi. it is served with a papaya relish called cheen, along with chopped onions, chillies and a kadhi-like dip. down this with a masala chai before continuing to explore some of the `pols‚Äô ‚Äì these are narrow alleys lined with old houses. you can see exquisitely carved wooded facades of havelis, perhaps a colourful jain or hindu temple, an ornate bird-feeding structure called chabutra, and other remnants of life in the old city.jalebi at chandra villas.from here, walk to the historical square called manek chowk. this forms the base to explore numerous markets: the sindhi market for fabrics and sarees, ratanpol where shop fronts showcase a variety from tailored shirts to colourful sarees, zaveri vad with its jewellery shops, dalgharwad for textiles and garments, and others. but should you find your stomach rumbling again, the bhatiyar galli of khas bazaar near manek chowk is a meat lovers haven. here you will find the cooks‚Äîknown as bhatiyaras frying meat on large tavas, ladling out meat on small plates, or making kebabs on charcoal stoves. bera samosa is one of the legendary names in this market‚Äîit is about a century old, and is famous for its spiced minced meat samosas that are often whisked away by food lovers to be eaten in the comfort of their homes. vegetarians, check out das khaman, one of the famous places in the city for gujarati farsan. about 100 years old, das khaman offers khaman, dhokla, khandvi and other local snacks.afternoon head west across the sabarmati to

printed stoles hang on displays.eveninghead to vishalla, a gujarati-themed restaurant with traditionally decorated mud huts where artisans demonstrate their skills. it also has a performance area for

waiters will quickly lay out a leaf platter, terracotta bowls and glasses that are deftly filled with authentic gujarati rural food. if you are not in the mood for a full meal, they also have a snacks area. the gujarati farsan and sweets like sukhdi and jalebi are superb, and you can wash it down with a seasonal drink or a cup of minty tea.day 2: morningthe university area of ahmedabad has many impressive architectural buildings like the indian institute of management (iim-a) designed by louis kahn, the achyut kavinde-designed ahmedabad textile industry's research association ( atira) with a lush green campus, and the ld institute of indology designed by bv doshi.from the university, it is a short drive to the sprawling bv doshi-designed shreyas foundation‚Äôs campus, which has lush

sunset. this remarkable development of urban planning has converted the two banks of the river in the city of ahmedabad into a multi-purpose space with parks, gardens, buildings, food zones,

majestic monuments of the walled city to the art galleries, trendy cafes and shopping streets, ahmedabad has a gamut of offerings. but for those with large appetites, the city holds many dleights. if you're in the city for just two days, here's where you should go and what you should eat.day 1: morningthe walled city of ahmedabad‚Äîor the old city‚Äîis a hive of activity with colourful bazaars, workshops, mosques, temples and old residential quarters called pols. it is best to get here early before the streets get too crowded for a casual walk around.start with breakfast at new irani restaurant near the bhadra fort. more than 60 years old and recently renovated, this caf√© is extremely popular for its bun maska ‚Äì you can see the workers slicing buns and buttering them near the arched entrance. if you are looking for a cooked breakfast, try the omelette and curries or a meat feast of paya, chicken masala and chaap.bun maska at new irani cafe.digest breakfast by walking around bhadra fort, the citadel founded by sultan ahmed shah in 1411 ad. there‚Äôs also teen darwaja, a triple archway built in the 15th century and jama masjid nearby, one of the most beautiful mosques in the country.mid-morning: feel like a cup of tea and a snack after the walk? chandra villas nearby is a restaurant that opened in 1898 and introduced the first ‚Äògujarati thali‚Äô of ahmedabad in 1901. the restaurant has, unfortunately, lost its oak furniture and british fans to a fire, but it still remains as popular has been for over a century. ask for the classic fafda-jalebi breakfast‚Äî the deep-fried crispy fafda pairs well with the sinfully sweet jalebi. it is served with a papaya relish called cheen, along with chopped onions, chillies and a kadhi-like dip. down this with a masala chai before continuing to explore some of the `pols‚Äô ‚Äì these are narrow alleys lined with old houses. you can see exquisitely carved wooded facades of havelis, perhaps a colourful jain or hindu temple, an ornate bird-feeding structure called chabutra, and other remnants of life in the old city.jalebi at chandra villas.from here, walk to the historical square called manek chowk. this forms the base to explore numerous markets: the sindhi market for fabrics and sarees, ratanpol where shop fronts showcase a variety from tailored shirts to colourful sarees, zaveri vad with its jewellery shops, dalgharwad for textiles and garments, and others. but should you find your stomach rumbling again, the bhatiyar galli of khas bazaar near manek chowk is a meat lovers haven. here you will find the cooks‚Äîknown as bhatiyaras frying meat on large tavas, ladling out meat on small plates, or making kebabs on charcoal stoves. bera samosa is one of the legendary names in this market‚Äîit is about a century old, and is famous for its spiced minced meat samosas that are often whisked away by food lovers to be eaten in the comfort of their homes. vegetarians, check out das

majestic monuments of the walled city to the art galleries, trendy cafes and shopping streets, ahmedabad has a gamut of offerings. but for those with large appetites, the city holds many dleights. if you're in the city for just two days, here's where you should go and what you should eat.day 1: morningthe walled city of ahmedabad‚Äîor the old city‚Äîis a hive of activity with colourful bazaars, workshops, mosques, temples and old residential quarters called pols. it is best to get here early before the streets get too crowded for a casual walk around.start with breakfast at new irani restaurant near the bhadra fort. more than 60 years old and recently renovated, this caf√© is extremely popular for its bun maska ‚Äì you can see the workers slicing buns and buttering them near the arched entrance. if you are looking for a cooked breakfast, try the omelette and curries or a meat feast of paya, chicken masala and chaap.bun maska at new irani cafe.digest breakfast by walking around bhadra fort, the citadel founded by sultan ahmed shah in 1411 ad. there‚Äôs also teen darwaja, a triple archway built in the 15th century and jama masjid nearby, one of the most beautiful mosques in the country.mid-morning: feel like a cup of tea and a snack after the walk? chandra villas nearby is a restaurant that opened in 1898 and introduced the first ‚Äògujarati thali‚Äô of ahmedabad in 1901. the restaurant has, unfortunately, lost its oak furniture and british fans to a fire, but it still remains as popular has been for over a century. ask for the classic fafda-jalebi breakfast‚Äî the deep-fried crispy fafda pairs well with the sinfully sweet jalebi. it is served with a papaya relish called cheen, along with chopped onions, chillies and a kadhi-like dip. down this with a masala chai before continuing to explore some of the `pols‚Äô ‚Äì these are narrow alleys lined with old houses. you can see exquisitely carved wooded facades of havelis, perhaps a colourful jain or hindu temple, an ornate bird-feeding structure called chabutra, and other remnants of life in the old city.jalebi at chandra villas.from here, walk to the historical square called manek chowk. this forms the base to explore numerous markets: the sindhi market for fabrics and sarees, ratanpol where shop fronts showcase a variety from tailored shirts to colourful sarees, zaveri vad with its jewellery shops, dalgharwad for textiles and garments, and others. but should you find your stomach rumbling again, the bhatiyar galli of khas bazaar near manek chowk is a meat lovers haven. here you will find the cooks‚Äîknown as bhatiyaras frying meat on large tavas, ladling out meat on small plates, or making kebabs on charcoal stoves. bera samosa is one of the legendary names in this market‚Äîit is about a century old, and is famous for its spiced minced meat samosas that are often whisked away by food lovers to be eaten in the comfort of their homes. vegetarians, check out das khaman, one of the famous places in the city for gujarati farsan. about 100 years old, das khaman offers khaman, dhokla, khandvi and other local snacks.afternoon head west across the sabarmati to
